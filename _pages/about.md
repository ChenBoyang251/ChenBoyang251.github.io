About me
======
I am currently a undergraduate senior student in Yao Class, Tsinghua University. I have a broad interest in quantum computer science and mathematics, especially quantum information, quantum algorithm, and algebra.

I was fortunate to be research intern in the group of Xiongfeng Ma in Tsinghua University since September 2021. I was also fortunate to be research intern in the group of Tongyang Li in Peking University since November 2021.

During the spring and summer of 2022, I was fortunate to visit QuICS of univeristy of Maryland, invited by Prof. xiaodi Wu.
