The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising candidate for quantum applications
on near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Despite a lot of empirical
studies and recent progress in theoretical understanding of VQEâ€™s optimization landscape, the
convergence for optimizing VQE is far less understood. We provide the first rigorous analysis
of the convergence of VQEs in the over-parameterization regime. By connecting the training
dynamics with the Riemannian Gradient Flow on the unit-sphere, we establish a threshold on
the sufficient number of parameters for efficient convergence, which depends polynomially on the
system dimension and the spectral ratio, a property of the problem Hamiltonian, and could be
resilient to gradient noise to some extent. We further illustrate that this over-parameterization
threshold could be vastly reduced for specific VQE instances by establishing an ansatz-dependent
threshold paralleling our main result. We showcase that our ansatz-dependent threshold could serve
as a proxy of the trainability of different VQE ansatzes without performing empirical experiments,
which hence leads to a principled way of evaluating ansatz design. Finally, we conclude with a
comprehensive empirical study that supports our theoretical findings.
